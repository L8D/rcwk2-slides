TODO: replace text here with a screenshot of the Heroku logotype?

Heroku is a great example of a project that works well out-of-the-box. You
can start up a git project, and spend less than 5 minutes getting some fresh
code to deploy somewhere.

However, Heroku is very limiting if you want to scale horizontally with many
distributed workers. If you start a project with Heroku, you will eventually
have to spend the time needed to adopt a much more challenging architecture.

Here are some pros.

# heroku

pros:

- easy to start using

???

Heroku is very east to start using if you've never heard of it before. Heroku
has a free tier that takes minutes to get most types of projects to work.

# heroku

pros:

- easy to start using
- out-of-the-box workflow for CI/CD

???

If you've never had the experience of watching Heroku build your application
on the CLI, it is pretty amazing.

This is a particular feature that I find very interesting and I would love to
have for my own continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline.

A great advantage of pushing to git over SSH is how fast it can be. If you've
worked with Heroku's web UI, Travis CI, Circle CI, etc. you know how laggy the
web clients can be.

With Heroku's user experience, when there is anything particularly wrong with a
build or test suite, you will know right away if you are pushing straight to
Heroku's git repositories. You get to watch the build fail in real-time.

It even support Docker! Docker is an essential tool for giving developers more
flexibility and control over what languages and libraries they use.

if you want to build a service-based system, scaling up to several workers can
be a pain in the ass.
